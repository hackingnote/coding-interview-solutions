Heapify
===


Problem
-------

Given an integer array, heapify it into a min-heap array.

For a heap array A, A[0] is the root of heap, and for each A[i], A[i * 2 + 1] is the left child of A[i] and A[i * 2 + 2] is the right child of A[i].

Example
-------

Given [3,2,1,4,5], return [1,2,3,4,5] or any legal heap array.
