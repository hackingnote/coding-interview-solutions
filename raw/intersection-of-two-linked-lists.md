Intersection of Two Linked Lists
===


Problem
-------

Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.

Example
-------

The following two linked lists:

    A:          a1 → a2
                       ↘
                         c1 → c2 → c3
                       ↗            
    B:     b1 → b2 → b3
    
begin to intersect at node c1.

Note
---------

- If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.
- The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.
- You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.

Challenge
---------

Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.

Solution
--------
