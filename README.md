Files are organized by programming languages; each language has it's own naming convension for file names:

- **Java**: file name must match class name.
  - `java/problem-name/Solution.java`
- **C++**: in Google C++ Style Guide, both `_` and `-` are allowed, but `_` is preferred. So we chose `_`.
  - `cpp/problem_name.cc`
- **Python**: `-` is NOT allowed in file names.
  - `python/problem_name.py`
- **JavaScript**: both `_` and `-` are allowed.
  - `javascript/problem_name.js`
- Go: all lower case, `_`.
