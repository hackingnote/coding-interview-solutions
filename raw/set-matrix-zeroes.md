Set Matrix Zeroes
===

Problem
-------

Given a m x n matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0. Do it in place.

Example
-------

Given a matrix

    [
      [1,2],
      [0,3]
    ],

return

    [
      [0,2],
      [0,0]
    ]

Note

Challenge
---------

Did you use extra space?
A straight forward solution using O(mn) space is probably a bad idea.
A simple improvement uses O(m + n) space, but still not the best solution.
Could you devise a constant space solution?
