Mini Twitter
===

## Problem

Implement a simple twitter. Support the following method:

postTweet(user_id, tweet_text). Post a tweet.
getTimeline(user_id). Get the given user's most recently 10 tweets posted by himself, order by timestamp from most recent to least recent.
getNewsFeed(user_id). Get the given user's most recently 10 tweets in his news feed (posted by his friends and himself). Order by timestamp from most recent to least recent.
follow(from_user_id, to_user_id). from_user_id followed to_user_id.
unfollow(from_user_id, to_user_id). from_user_id unfollowed to to_user_id.



## Example

postTweet(1, "LintCode is Good!!!")
>> 1
getNewsFeed(1)
>> [1]
getTimeline(1)
>> [1]
follow(2, 1)
getNewsFeed(2)
>> [1]
unfollow(2, 1)
getNewsFeed(2)
>> []
