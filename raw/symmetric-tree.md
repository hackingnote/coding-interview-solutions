Symmetric Tree

Problem
-------

[LeetCode 101](https://oj.leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/)

Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).

For example, this binary tree is symmetric:

        1
       / \
      2   2
     / \ / \
    3  4 4  3

But the following is not:

        1
       / \
      2   2
       \   \
       3    3
