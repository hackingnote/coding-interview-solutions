title: Move Zeroes
---


Problem
-------



Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
Notice

    You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
    Minimize the total number of operations.


Example
-------

Given nums = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12], after calling your function, nums should be [1, 3, 12, 0, 0].
